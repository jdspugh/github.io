# Introduction

Argon2 was the winner of [Password Hashing Competition (PHC)](https://www.password-hashing.net/) 2013 to 2015. Argon2 is a slow one-way hash function. You can read about different types of one-way hashing function, their characteristics and their uses in my post [One-Way Cryptographic Algorithms](https://jdspugh.github.io/2023/04/06/one-way-cryptographic-algorithms.html). Here we will look at different **implementations** of Argon2 and the **parameters** Argon2 accepts.

We will be looking at two main implementations:

* Reference C implementation: <https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2>
* Browser WASM implementation: <https://github.com/antelle/argon2-browser>

# Use in Cryptocurrency

The cryptocurrency, Nimiq, uses Argon2 with these settings:

| Settings | Parameter | Value |
|-|-|-|
| Algorithm variant || Argon2d |
| Memory cost | m | 512 Kb |
| Time cost | t | 1 iteration |
| Parallelism | p | 1 lane and 1 thread |

The fastest consumer grade hardware (GPUs, as no ASICs are available as of yet), as of April 2023, gives:

| Hardware | USD | Hash Rate | Cost (USD) |
|-|-|-|-|
| Radeon VII graphic card | 1816 | 800 h/s | $2.27 per h/s |
| Radeon RX 5700xt graphics card | 300 | 550 h/s | $0.55 per h/s |

Argon2 has three variants that have slightly different characteristics. They are summarised in the table below:

| Property | Argon2d | Argon2i | Argon2id |
|-|-|-|-|
| GPU Resistance | Highest | High | Mix |
| Memory Access Pattern | Data-dependent | Data-independent | Hybrid (Argon2i + Argon2d) |
| Recommended Use Cases | Password hashing | Use in cases where there is risk of side-channel attacks | Mix |
| Side-Channel Attack Resistance | No | Yes | Mix |

We used these Argon2 settings using the WebAssembly implementation at https://antelle.net/argon2-browser:

Argon2 settings:
* Memory: see table below
* Iterations: 1
* Hash Length: 32 bytes
* Parallelism: 2
* Type: Argon2d
