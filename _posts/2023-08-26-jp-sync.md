title: Implementing a Cloud (MacOS & Linux)

# Goal

I want to create a personal cloud for both data storage and fault tolerant service hosting over WANs.

I want the servers involved to be **geographically independent** to avoid problems such as natural disasters or large scale network outages. The geographical independence can potentially be leveraged to reduce latency to services located on servers closer to the user.

I want it to be **company independent** in case there is some problem with the company such as it going out of business.

# Implementation Choices

I chose **Node.js** as the implementation language to interface between detected file changes, via `jp-watch`, and the efficient low level file synchronisation protocol, `rsync`. The interfacing is not speed critical as the bulk of the work is done by `jp-watch` and `rsync`, so Node.js works well for this. At present I'm keeping most of my software as Javascript as it is so ubiquitous and able to be used front or back end.

For Linux the Node.js code is installed as a **service** via a small configuration file. This ensures it will start running on automatically on startup or a reboot.

# Configuration

The Node.js code reads settings from a configuration file. The file contains lines of the following format:

## Comments

Comments start with a `#` character, for example:

```
# This is a comment
```

## Paths Servers Services

```
<path> <server(s)> [<service>]
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-|-|
|`<path>`|file or directory to be recursively watched|
|`<servers>`|comma separated list of servers specified in `rsync` format i.e. `<fdqn / ip address>:<path>`.|
|`<service>`|an optional name of a service to be restarted once file synchronisation has completed|

Example

```
code                      myfqdn.com:/home/user/code
```

Synchronises the local `code` directory with the remote directory `/home/user/code` on the server `myfqdn.com`.

```
/var/www                  $SERVERS
```

Synchronises the `/var/www` directory between all the servers listed in the environment variable `SERVERS`. Any files synchronised within the `/var/www` directory will be immediately available on that server's web server. There is no need to restart the web server.

```
/etc/nginx/conf.d         $SERVERS nginx
```

Changes to Nginx configuration files will be automatically synchronised between servers listed in the server's `SERVERS` environment variable. The Nginx service will be restarted once the synchronisation has completed in order for the changes to become effective.

# Config2 ???

/etc/nginx/conf.d | SERVERS | root | service nginx restart |
/home/user/project1 | | | | username1@fqdn1:/var/www,username2@fqdn2:/var/www


# Linux Service Installation

Example for Ubuntu 22:

```
[Unit]
After=network.target

[Service]
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/home/user/jp-sync
EnvironmentFile=/etc/environment
ExecStart=/home/user/n/bin/node jp-sync.mjs

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
<figcaption>jp-sync.service</figcaption>


This service configuration file needs to be placed in the `/etc/systemd/system` directory.

It will be run at every system startup if you run:

```
$ sudo systemctl enable jp-sync
```

It can be restarted any time using:

```
$ sudo service jp-sync restart
```

In the example `/home/user/n/bin/node` is the location of the Node.js binary executable.

The `jp-sync.mjs` code is expected at `/home/user/jp-sync/jp-sync.mjs`.

Make sure any required environment variables have been saved on their own line in `/etc/environment` so that they will be available following a reboot, for example `SERVERS=mydomain1.com,mydomain2.com`.
