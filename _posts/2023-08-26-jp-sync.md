# Implementing a Cloud

I want to create a personal cloud for both data storage and fault tolerant service hosting over WANs.

I want the servers involved to be **geographically independent** to avoid problems such as natural disasters or large scale network outages. The geographical independence can potentially be leveraged to reduce latency to services located on servers closer to the user.

I want it to be **company independent** in case there is some problem with the company such as it going out of business.

# Implementation Decisions

I chose Node.js as the implementation language to interface between detected file changes, via `jp-watch`, and the efficient low level file synchronisation protocol, `rsync`. The interfacing is not speed critical as the bulk of the work is done by `jp-watch` and `rsync`, so Node.js works well for this. At present I'm keeping most of my software as Javascript as it is so ubiquitous and able to be used front or back end.

# Configuration

The configuration file contains lines of the following format:

## Comments

Comments start with a `#` character, for example:

```
# This is a comment
```

## Paths, Servers, Services

```
<path> <server(s)> [<service>]
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-|-|
|`<path>`|file or directory to be recursively watched|
|`<servers>`|comma separated list of servers specified in `rsync` format i.e. `<fdqn / ip address>:<path>`.|
|`<service>`|an optional name of a service to be restarted once file synchronisation has completed|

Example

```
code                      myfqdn.com:/home/user/code
```

Synchronises the local `code` directory with the remote directory `/home/user/code` on the server `myfqdn.com`.

```
/var/www                  $SERVERS
```

Synchronises the `/var/www` directory between all the servers listed in the environment variable `SERVERS`. Any files synchronised within the `/var/www` directory will be immediately available on that server's web server. There is no need to restart the web server.

```
/etc/nginx/conf.d         $SERVERS nginx
```

Changes to Nginx configuration files will be automatically synchronised between servers listed in the server's `SERVERS` environment variable. The Nginx service will be restarted once the synchronisation has completed in order for the changes to become effective.

# Linux Service Installation

Example for Ubuntu 22:

```
[Unit]
After=network.target

[Service]
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/home/user/jp-sync
EnvironmentFile=/etc/environment
ExecStart=/home/user/n/bin/node jp-sync.mjs

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

This service configuration file should be placed in the `/etc/systemd/system` directory.

It can be run at system startup using:

```
sudo systemctl enable jp-sync
```

It can be restarted using:

```
sudo service jp-sync restart
```

In the example `/home/user/n/bin/node` is the location of the Node.js binary executable.

The `jp-sync.mjs` code is expected at `/home/user/jp-sync/jp-sync.mjs`.

Make sure any required environment variables have been saved on their own line in `/etc/environment` so that they will be available following a reboot, for example `SERVERS=mydomain1.com,mydomain2.com`.
